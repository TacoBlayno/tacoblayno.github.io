## Project Website
This is my project to make a website. The home page can be viewed at https://tacoblayno.github.io/home.html.
### Doing
I am making a js file that contains code to view every page on my website. It will display as HTML in a format that looks like folders and files in a file system.
### plans
I will make a search engine to search through the entire website. When that is finished, everything will be accessible from there. The search engine will be designed to use one js file. The js file will contain code to access an xml file for its information.
