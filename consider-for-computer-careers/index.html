    <h2>Description</h2> 

    <h3>Computer Science</h3>

    <p>As stated by University of Kansas:</p> 

    <p>“Computer scientists study the very nature of computing and information in order to advance the state of the art. They often specialize in software design and implementation through web development, interface design, mobile computing, and other areas. Computer scientists address fundamental computing problems, such as the efficient and secure collection of information. From medicine and business to video games and films, they are devising new ways to use computers. Integrating the theoretical aspects of computing with real-world applications offers an array of industry and research opportunities for computer scientists. Information technology (IT) professionals have a complex demanding job that requires a solid foundation in applied computing and management skills. In overseeing the IT infrastructure, they must select and integrate the appropriate hardware and software to meet the needs of the organization. They must define the requirements of the system and then design, deploy, integrate, and maintain system throughout its lifecycle. In addition to their vast computing knowledge, IT professionals must be able to communicate the impact of technology decisions to non-technical coworkers along with the latest policies and trends in IT.”</p>
