    <h1>About TacoBlayno</h1>
    <h2>Interest in Computers</h2>
    <p>I have wanted to work with computers for as long as I can remember. When I was 6 I understood they they were incredibly complex, and I wanted to solve problems, and face challenges. I saw an opportunity to do that with computers.</p>
    <p>When I told my mother, she basically made it sound as boring as possible, and that made me debate with myself about if she was really saying what it was like to work with computers or was just blabbering (chosen for lack of a better word).</p>
    <p>When I was 13, I was learning math on Khan Academy (more like taking tests and figuring out how to get the correct answers based on logic, and the answers it said were correct). During that time, I saw a code editor. I started playing around with it, and reading the documentation. I couldn't write anything, because I didn't put a semi colon at the end of each line (even thought it was JavaScript, Khan Academy forced semi colons). When I was looking in the documentation, I realized that there was a link to learn how to program. I clicked it, and started taking Khan Academy's Unit 1: Intro to JS: Drawing & Animations course.</p>
    <p>I had no prior experience, but I caught on quickly, and I learned the ProcessingJs library, and JavaScript (without the BOM and DOM). I loved it so much that I took many of the others. I haven't completed all of them, but I developed some skills.</p>
    <p>Now I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some Java, Python, and some C/C++.</p>
    <p>I am researching so I can build on operating system, a programming language, and and assembler. That is significant evidence that I love challenges.</p>
