    <h1>About the Shapes Behavior Pack</h1>
    <p>I started developing the shapes behavior pack because I wanted to experiment with adding commands  to Minecraft. I thought to myself, what commands should be added to Minecraft? After much thought I came to the conclusion that Minecraft could use shaped fill commands, so I started adding the behatior pack for it.</p>
