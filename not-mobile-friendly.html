    <h1>Not mobile friendly</h1>
    <p style="width: 1000px;">I noticed that safari has mobile websites, and one must reques the desktop website to get it, so I am experimenting to see if the mobile website is something apple does to make websites that aren't mobile friendly become mobile friendly.</p>
